    <h1>SouthPark</h1>
<p class="first">
    South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for Comedy Central. The series revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their exploits in and around the titular Colorado town. South Park became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics toward an adult audience.

    <p>Eric Theodore Cartman, often referred to just by his surname,[1] is the main character in the adult animated television series South Park, created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and is voiced by Parker. He is one of the series' four central characters, along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick, though he is considered the main character of the show. A prototypical version of Cartman (called Kenny) first appeared in the 1992 animated short, Jesus vs. Frosty, later appearing in the 1995 animated short Jesus vs. Santa, and first appeared on television in the pilot episode of South Park, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", on August 13, 1997.</p>

<p>Kenny is a third, later fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family. Kenny is animated by computer to look as he did in the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, in which his true appearance and voice were first revealed, and various South Park merchandise.
